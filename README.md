# Learning How To TDD Using Jest

#### 29th May 2019

> Today I had a paring session with Alice to learn how to TDD with jest.
> She expelained to me the concept of ``callback`` functions, ``event loop`` in javaScript and testing Asyn code.
> We also found out that ``beforeEach`` in ``jest`` does not work the same as ``beforeEach`` in ``RSpec``.
> She said I had a good understanding of ``event loop`` and that I need to look into ``testing `` them.
